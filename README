			    Wubi Practice

Usage
-----

In practice mode, the following keys have special meanings:
- escape : return to the main menu
- z      : show the solution
- \      : show the solution for the last one

This is a fairly minimal implementation, but I hope it will help you improve.

Compilation
-----------

The program requires the SDL library. You can compile it with cmake:

  > mkdir build && cd build
  > cmake ..
  > make

Note that program needs the 3 .dat files to be in the directory where you're running it from.
